            <p>
                In case of the section on the left not working (if so please contact the developer (thanks)), my name is Joshua Whittington, a junior Full-stack web developer committed to writing clean and meaningful code. I've always had an interest in developing code for things like websites, dating all the way back to my time in high-school, but recently I've picked it back up again and began pursuing a career doing something I enjoy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like to think I'm creative: I always have ideas floating around in my head for new and exciting things to do, and while I may not always act on
                them, they're always there waiting for their turn to be brought to life.
            </p>

                        In due time this will have some work history related to web development, but for now, I'm a junior web developer trying to set foot into the field. As far as my roles in other jobs go, I've had numerous experiences working as part of a team.
